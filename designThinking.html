    <h2> Re-Imagining Spaces </h2>
    <p> In this project, I choose two specific locations such as the Cafeteria Atrium on the Lincoln Center campus of Fordham University and 1 Central Park West to re-imagine with the intention to better use and assign new meanings to these spaces. To make my imagination a reality or near reality, I used Adobe Photoshop to visually present my re-imagination of these spaces.</p>
    <p> I imagined the LC Cafeteria Atrium to be more lively, encouraging to tune in with your inner self as well as a space where you can discover new, free books. Since LC Cafeteria Atrium is somewhat like a greenhouse, better use of the space would be to have plants in there. So that while people study, they can breathe fresh air (not to say there isn&apos;t any but plants make it better). As someone who is a bookish person, I thought a shelf full of books would be useful since knowledge is a great way to purify the mind. Since there is a shelf with books, I thought adding some stools would encourage people to sit and read. As you look through the photos below, you can notice that I had removed and modified things from the original photo. I removed the garbage can and the table as well as moved the fire alarm to the left for the reimagined plants to fit well.</p>

    <h2> Prototyping </h2>
    <h2> The Fate Of Bangladeshi College Graduate: Can't Get A Job </h2>
    <p> Thousands of college graduates fail to find a job in Bangladesh. They either have to have a family connection or give bribes to institutions and recruiters to get a job. But most people who strive for education are the ones who want to change their financial circumstances. Therefore, they don&apos;t have the means to give bribes or a family connection to get a job. This results in young people not pursuing higher education or their families not allowing them since there is no way to get a job after graduation. </p>
    <p>A study was conducted by The World Bank, sponsoring financial and technical support, with the objectives of improving the quality of education and governance of the university sector in Bangladesh. The study was based on interviews with 2,350 graduates from colleges that are National University affiliated, 235 employers who employed graduates at that time, and principals and vice-principals of 35, government and non-government, colleges. More details of the study can be found by a quick search of <q>Graduate Employability of Affiliated Colleges New Evidence from Bangladesh</q> on any search engine (Google etc.) </p>
    <p> Some interesting key findings of the study were that <q>20 percent of graduates are employed while nearly half, 46 percent, of graduates remain unemployed after three years of graduation.</q> Additionally, the labor market of Bangladesh has <q>significant skills shortages and the NU-affiliated colleges have a big role to play to narrow the existing skills gap.</q> Lastly, out of the 235 employers interviewed, <q>only 10 entities (4 percent) reported having some type of relationship with colleges.</q> </p>
    <p> To sum up, the problem is that a significant number of college graduates are facing unemployment in Bangladesh. One of the causes of this problem, according to the study, is that college graduates do not meet labor market demands: skills shortage among these college graduates. The study, interestingly, suggests that only 4 percent of the interviewed employers have some kind of connection with colleges. This implies that the root for the unemployment of college graduates in Bangladesh is the lack of connection between colleges and employers.</p>
    <h2> How About An Approach to the problem? </h2>
    <p> Since we have simplified the root of unemployment of college graduates in Bangladesh, which is the lack of connection between colleges and employers. It is indeed crucial for colleges to have connections with employers and vice versa. This is because being in a classroom is not enough for someone to handle real-world situations, hence, colleges need to provide ways for students to experience the real world along with learning in a classroom. As much as colleges need to prepare their students for real-world situations, employers need employees to move forward with their existence and these students are the future of those institutions. In this context, the relationship between colleges and employers is somewhat dependent on each other. In order for colleges and employers to reach their goals/needs, it is necessary for them to cooperate.</p>
    <p> An approach can be taken by designing an application that allows colleges and employers to cooperate to prepare students for the real world after graduation. It can be done through creating various internships, paid and unpaid, while students are in college. So that students can have the skill set an employer wants by the time they graduate. Some internships could be unpaid but a position is guaranteed once completed. The application can have opportunities that recognize the need of students and the capacity of the employers.</p>

    <h2> Podcasting </h2>
    <img class="episode" src= "podcasting.png" alt="Episode 3" title="Episode 3" />
    <p> When school went remote in the Spring of 2020, it also meant that the college process went remote. This was only an added challenge for immigrant students like me who are the first in their families to apply to and attend college in the United States. I had to navigate language barriers, confusing websites, financial aid forms, and decision deadlines with only the help of my college counselor, who became harder to reach when the pandemic struck because she was understandably juggling work and home life. In this podcast, I shared what it&apos;s like to be an immigrant student going through the college process during a pandemic.</p>
    <p> I reported the story as a high school senior in the podcast season <q>Students in a Pandemic,</q> which was produced by <a href="https://www.bellvoices.org/about-us" target="_blank">The Bell</a> in partnership with<a href="https://hechingerreport.org/about/" target="_blank"> The Hechinger Report</a>. Both organizations focus on inequality and innovation in education.
